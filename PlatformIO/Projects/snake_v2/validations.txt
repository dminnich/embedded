Validations:

Relay times--
const uint8_t growonh = 10;
const uint8_t growoffh = 13;
- One before start.  
- One on start
- One during time
- One on off hour
- One after off hour
9 = off - no GL - GOOD
10 = on - GL - GOOD
12 =on  - GL -  GOOD
13 = off - no GL - GOOD
14 = off  - no GL - GOOD
GL means relay is on as well

const uint8_t offtemp = 10;
- One below temp 
- One at temp
- One above temp
9 = on - HL - GOOD
10 = off - no HL - GOOD
11 = off - no HL - GOOD
HL means relay is on as well


Roughly int relaypauses = 5 time between Serial Relay prints - GOOD

US and World time - GOOD

F and C temp - GOOD

Debug level NTP to make sure it only requests it const uint16_t ntppollsec = 21600; and that caching is working - GOOD

make sure its roughly  const uint8_t looppauses = 1; between loop executions - GOOD


temps are correct.  - GOOD
time is correct. - GOOD
